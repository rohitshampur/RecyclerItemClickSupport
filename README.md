# RecyclerItemClickSupport



RecyclerView is a great class what you should consider over ListView for building list interfaces. It offers more flexibility and has built-in hooks that make implementing animations and custom layouts much easier compared to ListView.

Fortunately, RecyclerView supplies a addOnItemTouchListener that will catch all touch events on the item View. You can hook up a GestureDetector to figure out what happens and trigger an action from there. This has some problems as well. If you donâ€™t implement this correctly, the GestureDetector will steal touch events and will mess up things like ripples. Also, the target view is never actually receiving the touch events in that case so your code has to emulate what happens when you click on a view to handle haptic feedback, sound effects and accessibility events.

So the solution is to let the view which is the item in your RecyclerView, or more precisely, the ViewHolder.getItemView() handle the click.

The resulting code to hook up a click listener now looks like this:

```java

RecyclerItemClickSupport.addTo(mRecyclerView).setOnItemClickListener(new RecyclerItemClickSupport.OnItemClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemClicked(RecyclerView recyclerView, int position, View v) {
        // do something
    }
});
```

To use this library add below dependency to build.gradle 

```gradle

repositories{
        jcenter()
    }


dependencies {
compile 'com.rohit.recycleritemclicksupport:recycleritemclicksupport:1.0.1'
}
```
